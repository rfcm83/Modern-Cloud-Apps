# Modern Cloud Apps

The Contoso Sports League Association (CSLA) is one of the largest sports franchises and is struggling to keep up with demand from their growing user base. They currently host an e-commerce website and have a backend website that supports their call center, allowing employees to view order information.

CSLA would like to modernize their websites and move to the cloud, ultimately moving away from managing infrastructure. They are interested in whether Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) will meet their needs so they can completely remove the infrastructure management overhead. However, they are concerned about securing their websites and data to meet the stringent PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance requirements.

## Target audience

Application developers

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will work as a group to implement an end-to-end solution for e-commerce that is based on Azure App Services, Azure Active Directory, and Azure DevOps. You will ensure the solution is PCI compliant, and appropriate security measures are put into place for both on-premises and public access scenarios.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to deploy and configure Azure Web Apps and associated services. In addition, you will learn to configure Web Apps for authentication with Azure AD, instrument and load-test the application with App Insights, and automate back-end services using Azure Functions and Logic Apps.

### Whiteboard design session

In the whiteboard design session, you will work in groups to design a solution to modernize CSLA's e-commerce and back-end services while maintaining existing PCI compliance. To ensure compliance, you will ensure data privacy and protection across all aspects of the system, in transit and at rest. The goal is to use Azure PaaS services for the public-facing and back-end websites, while providing a way for the on-premises components to securely communicate with these services. You will also design fault-tolerance and a regional failover plan of the Azure components.

By the end of this whiteboard design session, you will have a better understanding of how to modernize a legacy web app by retargeting it for the cloud, taking advantage of the many services Azure provides to enhance functionality and secure your solution's components by following best practices for PCI compliance and security.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure.

Please note that as opposed to the Whiteboard Design Session, the lab is not focused on maintaining PCI compliance and using more advanced security features such as App Service Environment, Network Security Groups, and Application Gateway. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.
